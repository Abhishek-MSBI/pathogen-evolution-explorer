# ðŸ§¬ Pathogen Evolution Explorer

A web-based application for analyzing pathogen genomic sequences and exploring their evolutionary relationships. Built with Streamlit and Biopython.

## Features

- **Sequence Statistics**: Calculate and visualize basic sequence metrics including GC content and length statistics
- **Sequence Comparison**: Generate similarity matrices and interactive heatmaps to compare multiple sequences
- **Phylogenetic Analysis**: Create interactive phylogenetic trees to visualize evolutionary relationships
- **Sample Datasets**: Includes pre-loaded datasets for SARS-CoV-2 variants, Influenza H1N1, and E. coli strains

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathogen-evolution-explorer.git
cd pathogen-evolution-explorer
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the application:
```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## Usage
